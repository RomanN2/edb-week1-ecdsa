## WEEK 1: ECDSA Node Project

This is a week 1 (Blockchain Cryptography) project for the Ethereum Dev. Bootcamp course.

It is built based on the example project provided by the Alchemy University. The example project was extended in a way that server allow transfers only for address owners who needs to sign the transactions using their private keys.

 
### Client

The client folder contains a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application 
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

### Server

The server folder contains a node.js server using [express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder 
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies 
3. Run `node index` to start the server 

Note: index.js file contains generated private keys to test the project.

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically! 

_Hint_ - Use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) instead of `node` to automatically restart the server on any changes.
